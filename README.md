# vue-cli-ssr

Vue CLI 4 project configured to support [SSR](https://ssr.vuejs.org/).

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (SSR)

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/search and check the logs

- If it's server-side rendered, the log will be on the terminal.
- If it's client-side rendered, the log will be on the browser.

With `yarn serve`, SSR won't work.
